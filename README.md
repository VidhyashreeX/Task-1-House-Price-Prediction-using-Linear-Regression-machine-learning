# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

![House](https://img.shields.io/badge/House%20Price-Prediction-brightgreen)

Welcome to the **House Price Prediction** project, a part of my vital internship with Bharat Intern. In this project, we delve into the fascinating world of Machine Learning, specifically Linear Regression, to predict house prices based on various key factors and features. Whether you are a budding data scientist, a real estate enthusiast, or someone with a keen interest in property market dynamics, this project offers valuable insights and practical applications.

## About the Project

The real estate market is one of the most significant and dynamic sectors in the global economy. Accurate prediction of house prices is essential for buyers, sellers, and investors to make informed decisions. In this project, we harness the power of Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning technique, to create a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on a variety of features.

## Features

 **Data Collection**: We collect data from various sources, including property attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, and more.

 **Data Preprocessing**: We clean and prepare the data, handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering to make it suitable for training.

 **Linear Regression**: We implement the Linear Regression algorithm to create a model that can predict house prices.

 **Model Evaluation**: We assess the performance of our model using various metrics, including mean squared error and R-squared.

 **Deployment**: Depending on the project's scope, you can explore deploying the model for real-time house price predictions.
